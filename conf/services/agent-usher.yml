accessibilityProblems:
  - There is no timeout dialog box in this service, so users will not be warned before being logged out
  - The opt-in page contains images that are not clickable (to enlarge) and appear blurred
  - There is no error summary on the opt-in page, just a form field error. The error summary would normally allow a user to quickly identify errors and allow them to navigate directly to the error

      Some of the pages in the service have a redundant fieldset, which could prevent users browsing out of context from understanding what is being selected. This doesnâ€™t meet WCAG success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 4.1.1 (Parsing).

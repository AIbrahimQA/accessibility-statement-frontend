    People using a screen reader may occasionally: not automatically be given part of the information that is visible on
    a page, need to navigate away from a question or around a page to find all the information they need to answer a
    question, or correct their answer, hear some content (such as page titles) twice in a row
  - We sometimes require signed documents to be uploaded. There are
    alternative ways of providing these for people who are unable to do
    this or who would find this difficult, due to a disability.

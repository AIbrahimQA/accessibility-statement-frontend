serviceDescription: |
  This service allows you to check the rateable value of your property. This
  is set by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and used by your local council to
  calculate your business rates bill. You can claim an interest in a property
  and view the valuation details of other properties. You can also request
  changes to property details if you think they're wrong, and challenge the
  rateable value if eligible.

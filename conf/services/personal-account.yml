serviceDescription: |
  The Digital Contact Preference service is a collection of micro services that worktogether to achieve the business objective of helping customers 
  'go paperless with HMRC'. It also includes the Email service, which sends transactional email to HMRC customers. The Message service and relevant 
  renderers provide 'Message Inbox' functionality. Users' desire to receive paperless communication is captured by the Preference service. These 
  services rely upon scheduled jobs, which push data from one Microservice to another.

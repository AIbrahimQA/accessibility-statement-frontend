  Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) is a UK and EU-wide computer system that’s used to record duty suspended movements of excise goods taking place within the UK and the EU.

  EMCS captures and processes information about the movements online, validates the data entered and allows real time notification of the dispatch and receipt of duty suspended excise goods.

  It allows the exchange of secure online messages containing specific consignment and movement information between UK and EU trading partners.

  - Screen reader users may have difficulty due to superfluous radio buttons, empty heading, non-descriptive links, page titles and legend attributes, a timeout without informing users and instructions that rely heavily on visual locations.
  - Keyboard-only users may experience issues with the tab order, elements that do not receive focus via the focus indicator, and a skip to content link that is not visible or focusable.
  - Low vision users have an issue relating to the reflow of each page whereby content could not be read in a single column, which requires the use of horizontal scrolling.
  - Cognitive impaired, Dyslexic and voice activation users should be able to navigate through the service using assistive technology without encountering any accessibility barriers.

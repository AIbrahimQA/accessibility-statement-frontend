  Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) is a UK and EU-wide computer system that’s used to record duty suspended movements of excise goods taking place within the UK and the EU.

  EMCS captures and processes information about the movements online, validates the data entered and allows real time notification of the dispatch and receipt of duty suspended excise goods.

  It allows the exchange of secure online messages containing specific consignment and movement information between UK and EU trading partners.

accessibilityProblems:                  # If there are no issues do not include this section
  - the service times out without giving users due warning or the option to extend their session
  - some of the instructions for the service are only shown in images rather than explained in text
  - some page titles, headings and links are not descriptive
  - not all labels and functions have been put in place for keyboard navigation and screen readers, so the information given to users may be incomplete, in the wrong order or unclear
  - pages cannot be formatted as a single column, which means users may have to scroll horizontally to find the information they need
  - users cannot skip to the main content when using keyboard navigation or a screen reader
milestones: # If there are no issues do not include this section
  - description: "The service times out without giving users due warning or the option to extend their session, which can cause issues for people that cannot complete the task within the time limit. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.1 (timing adjustable). This will be fixed by 23 September 2021 by allowing users to extend the session or turn the time limit off. "

  - description: "Some of the instructions for the service are only shown in images rather than explained in text, which makes the service harder to use for people with visual impairments. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.1.1 (non-text content) or 1.3.3 (sensory characteristics). This will be fixed by 23 September 2021 by putting all the instructions into a format that does not depend on visual perception. "

  - description: "Some page titles, headings and links are not descriptive, so users may find it harder to navigate the service using assistive technologies. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.4.2 (page titled), 2.4.4 (link purpose) or 2.4.6 (headings and labels). This will be fixed by 23 September 2021 by replacing these with descriptive page titles, headings and links."

  - description: "Not all labels and functions have been put in place for keyboard navigation and screen readers, so the information given to users may be incomplete, in the wrong order or unclear. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships), 2.4.3 (focus order), 2.4.7 (focus visible) or 4.1.3 (status messages). This will be fixed by 23 September 2021 by adding the appropriate markup and functionality."

  - description: "Pages cannot be formatted as a single column, which means users may have to scroll horizontally to find the information they need. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow). This will be fixed by 23 September 2021 by updating the code to allow for the reflowing of content without loss of information or functionality.  "
    date: 2021-09-23
  - description: "Users cannot always skip to the main content when using keyboard navigation or a screen reader, which means these users may have to go through the same information on multiple pages, for example, headers and menu links. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks). This will be fixed by 23 September 2021 by adding mechanisms to allow the user to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages in the service."

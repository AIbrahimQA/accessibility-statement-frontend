accessibilityProblems:
  - Some of the pages in the service have a redundant fieldset, which could prevent users browsing out of context from understanding what is being selected
  - The input field on the 'Do you have any tax registration numbers in your country?' page is unlabelled, which may prevent some users from understanding what they need to enter into the field
  - The 'Have you applied for money laundering supervision with HMRC?' page does not have a fieldset and legend attribute, so the purpose of the radio buttons may be unclear for some users
  - The 'Remove' button on the 'Your tax registration numbers' page does not have a descriptive link
  - The 'Your tax registration numbers' page does not have a legend attribute, so the purpose of the radio buttons may be unclear for some users

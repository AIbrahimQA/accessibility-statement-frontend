accessibilityProblems:
  - at one point we display location information on a map - however,
    there’s also a postcode lookup tool that’s accessible to visually
    impaired users using assistive technology
  - At one point we display a payment iFrame, which is controlled by Barclaycard.
    Visually impaired users may find it difficult to navigate, even with
    assistive technology.
  - There are some error messages in this service that may not be descriptive
    enough for some users with visual impairments - however they are
    compatible with common assistive technology tools.
  - At some point we display pages where the formatting for individual
    elements on screen are not fully suitable for screen reading technologies
    and results in a difficult to navigate page due to incomplete information.
    However using a screen reader to read back the entire page will provide
    all the information needed to navigate the page with confidence.
milestones:
  - description: We use a Barclaycard iFrame to take the card details and payments for
      the charge or tax users are paying. This iFrame does not give users the
      chance to confirm their details once they have entered them. This does
      not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.6.

  - description: We use titles on our webpages in order to describe the topic or purpose of
      the page that the user is currently viewing. In some instances, the Tab
      titles and main titles are not consistent. This means the service does
      not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6.
    date: 2020-03-31
  - description: We use page headings and subheadings to describe the topic or purpose of
      fields in a webpage. On certain pages there are level 3 headings that are
      actually level 2 headings, which causes people using screen readers to receive unclear information regarding the page. This means the service does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.10
    date: 2020-03-31
  - description: We use radio buttons to present users with options on our webpages, these
      are grouped together to enable easier navigation for keyboard only users.
      In some instances, these groups are missing their labelling, which
      prevents some screen reading software from narrating the label. This means
      the service does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.6.
